      <description>ABSTRACT
Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been proposed as methods to measure bone quality and assess fracture risk. However, manual segmentation of MRI/CT is time-consuming which limits its use in clinical practice. It is also costly at the same time. Moreover, the traditional methods that are available to this date are not robust. Our thesis goal is to present an automatic femur segmentation method based on deep Con- volutional Neural Networks (CNNs).</description>
