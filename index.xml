Problem Statement Link to heading DQN was able to solve problems in high-dimensional observation spaces, but action spaces neeeded to be discrete and low-dimensional because each step optimizes over state values. This makes DQN not useful for robotic walking for example. The paper relies on Deep Reinforcement Learning to find multiple coupling action and observation space mappings simultaneously. Physical control task as mentioned have continuous, high-dimensional action spaces.</description>

Problem Statement Link to heading Introduction
The more deeper a deep neural network is, the more computational complexity is added to the training process. For example, a training a deep neural network may face exploding or vanishing gradiant problem, which result in compromising accuracy of the model. This paper introduced a new technique to combat the problem of training a deep neural network. They present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously.</description>

Problem Statement Link to heading Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the effective ways of training deep networks, and SGD variants such as momentum etc. Batch normalization improves SGD and comes with few advanteages. At the same time, this approach comes with some issues like it requires more sophisticated parameter initilalization and make the training process hard.</description>

      <description>ABSTRACT
Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been proposed as methods to measure bone quality and assess fracture risk. However, manual segmentation of MRI/CT is time-consuming which limits its use in clinical practice. It is also costly at the same time. Moreover, the traditional methods that are available to this date are not robust. Our thesis goal is to present an automatic femur segmentation method based on deep Con- volutional Neural Networks (CNNs).</description>

Abstract
Parts of Speech (pos) tagging corresponds to techniques of tagging accurate pos tags of each word of a sentence. It is a pivotal and indispensable part of sentiment analysis, synthesizing text to speech, analyzing textual data and many more Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Though there are many researches done in the field of languages like English, Chinese, etc. it is still comparatively unexplored for Bangla.</description>
