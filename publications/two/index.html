    <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p>Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been proposed as methods to measure bone quality and assess fracture risk. However, manual segmentation of MRI/CT is time-consuming which limits its use in clinical practice. It is also costly at the same time. Moreover, the traditional methods that are available to this date are not robust.
Our thesis goal is to present an automatic femur segmentation method based on deep Con- volutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We performed experiments by training two different CNN architectures with very different feature maps, and layers, and tested their segmenta- tion performance using k-fold cross-validation. Automatic segmentation of the femur CT using CNNs achieved a high similarity score. The high segmentation accuracy provided by CNNs has the potential to help bring the use of structural MRI measurements of bone quality into clinical practice for the management of osteoporosis.
We propose two deep CNN models called the U-Net and the 3D U-Net to segment femur bone DICOM images. Our 26 patient datasets ( which were later augmented to be 39 pa- tient datasets) were used to train, validate and test the CNN models, and 13 patient datasets are used to test the models. To the best of our knowledge, no works involving U-Net and 3D U-Net has been done before on human femur bones. We showed that 3D U-Net trained on accurate ground truth can predict with significant accuracy and precision.</p>
